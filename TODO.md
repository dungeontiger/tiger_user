TODO
=====

Things I need to do before this class can really be sharable:

- remove the dependency on external configuration
- change constructor to accept the configuration parameters
- add documentation
- add unit tests
- add sample code

Other features that I would like to add:

- static function for returning a hint about password strength to use with AJAX and jQuery
