==========

PHP User class to manage creation and login of users.  Can be integrated into any PHP project.

Yes there are many classes out there that do the same thing and even do it better.
I decided to do write this since I felt it necessary to do it once in my career at least.
I've also decide to put it up on github since I've been struggling with horrible 
source control recently and want to see what git is all about.
